### literaure review: 
- examining the details of their quadratic programming (QP) solvers
- the benchmarks they utilize
- any other pertinent information

https://pypi.org/project/qpsolvers/
https://pypi.org/project/qpsolvers_benchmark/


### Implementation: 
#### bonus
- when the problem is infeasible
- non-convex case
- 退化

### Test: 
evaluate the model’s performance
- analyzing the impact of parameter variations within the model 
and plotting the resulting outcomes, 
- deploying the model across different datasets to compare its performance

**include a comprehensive textual introduction, accompanied by relevant figures and charts**
